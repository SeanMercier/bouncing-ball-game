 Brief description of the animation achieved: player moving around a designated area, if get to the other side, he wins and gets to enter his name. 
 
 Known bugs/problems: once the player has gotten to the other side and enters his name, 
 the player is repositionned back to its original x and y coordinates and sometimes immediately moves in the same direction it was going towards before getting the message to pop up.
 
 Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment (no need to reference lecture/lab materials): 
 The hardest game in the world is where I got my idea from nut I wasn't able to get a functionning collision detection between the player and the squares.
 Stack Overflow, the labs and help from other peers was used to help me when i was stuck or to find different ways of approaching the game.
